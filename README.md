# Flight-Crash-Analysis---K-Means-Clustering
Descriptive study on historical flight crashes Using Python 

Business Goals:

Few weeks back one of the biggest strategies in aviation industry happened. 157 were killed who belonged to 35 nationalities. Ethiopian Airlines A737-Max8 crashed in Ethiopia. This is the second major flight accident happening in last 6 months. This is also the first time in aviation history where two flights of the same kind gets crashed in a quick span. 
Our goal is to use the historical records of Flight crashes and do a descriptive study on the crashes and get few insights out of it to address the problems in airline safety. The insights that we obtain could be useful for both Flight manufacturers and the Airline owners whose sentiment and market depends on the Safety of the Airlines.  

Business Questions:

•	At what part of a day do the air crashes generally happen?
Time is an important aspect to see. We will use the time of crash to segment it to day or night. We will try to get some insights if light outside the aircraft has some role on flight crashes. 
•	Military vs Civilian which aircrafts are more prone to crashes?
Based upon operator of crashes, we can get few insights by visulaizing the military vs non military aircrafts. 
•	Which operator is dangerous?
Looking at the flight operator, we will perform some exploratory data analysis to identify the most dangerous flight operators. 
•	Which Aircraft type is dangerous?
Looking at the aircraft type, we will perform some exploratory data analysis to identify the most dangerous flight operators. 
•	What does the general Flight Crash summary say?
Analyzing the text in summary section that tells what caused the crash will give us a very good knowledge on what are the general reasons for flight crashes.
